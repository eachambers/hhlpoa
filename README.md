# Halls and Hawk Lakes Property Owners Association (HHLPOA)

This repository contains code and data for the analyses included in the 2025 Lake Plan for the [Halls and Hawk Lakes Property Owners Association](https://hallshawklakes.ca/). Data was collected from a variety of sources, but most was obtained from monitoring surveys conducted by Trent University and the [U-Links Centre for Community-Based Research](https://www.ulinks.ca/), the [Trent-Severn Waterway Historic National Site](https://parks.canada.ca/lhn-nhs/on/trentsevern), and the [Ontario Lake Partner Program](https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/ontario-lake-partner), a volunteer-run program to gather data pertaining to lake health. The HHLPOA Lake Plan Committee also conducted a survey among association members in early 2025; results and analyses from this survey are included here as well.

The analyses are divided into two main scripts:
1. Analyses related to **lake health**. See the knitted markdown [here](https://github.com/eachambers/hhlpoa/blob/main/analysis/Lake_Trends.md). These analyses included examinations of:
  - Ice out dates
  - Water clarity
  - Water quality
  - Algal growth
  - Benthic monitoring
  - Lake level fluctuations 
2. Analyses related to the **survey results**. See the knitted markdown [here](https://github.com/eachambers/hhlpoa/blob/main/analysis/Lake_Survey.md).
