## Background

We want to assess survey responses based on four factors:

1.  Age of association member

2.  Length of property ownership

3.  The lake that the member has property on

4.  Type of property access

Survey responses have been categorized into five categories:

1.  Nature

2.  Development

3.  Legislation

4.  Lake use

5.  Amenities

# Import data

```{r}
dat <- read_csv(here("data", "lake_plan_survey.csv"))
```

# Run MANOVA

### Nature

```{r, results='hide'}
# Response variables
nature_resp <- cbind(dat$Preserve_Natural_Beauty, dat$Preserve_Natural_Shorelines,
                     dat$Preserve_Unique_Habitats, dat$Protect_Native_Species, 
                     dat$Control_Invasive_Species, dat$Improve_Water_Quality,
                     dat$Encourage_Dark_Skies, dat$Increase_Water_Clarity, 
                     dat$Decrease_Bacterial_Levels, dat$Reduce_Algal_Growth, 
                     dat$Minimize_Water_Fluctuations)

# Lake as predictor
Lake_manova <- manova(nature_resp ~ Lake, data = dat)
# Age
Age_manova <- manova(nature_resp ~ Age, data = dat)
# Duration
Duration_manova <- manova(nature_resp ~ Duration, data = dat)
# Access
Access_manova <- manova(nature_resp ~ Access, data = dat)

#Summary
summary(Lake_manova)
summary.aov(Lake_manova)
#Summary
summary(Age_manova)
summary.aov(Age_manova)
#Summary
summary(Duration_manova)
summary.aov(Duration_manova)
#Summary
summary(Access_manova)
summary.aov(Access_manova)
```

Visualize MANOVA results using a profile plot for nature-related questions and respondent age as a predictor.

```{r}
# Calculate group-based mean responses
age_means <- dat %>% 
  # Group by the predictor variable
  # TODO change below to whichever predictor variable you want (e.g., Lake, Duration, etc.)
  group_by(Age) %>% 
  # TODO change below to whichever response variables relate to the category; in this case I'm specifying a range of columns (denoted using the : symbol) starting from Preserve_Natural_Beauty until Minimize_Water_Fluctuations
  summarize_at(vars(Preserve_Natural_Beauty:Minimize_Water_Fluctuations), 
               mean, na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  # The following 'tidies' the dataset so that you no longer have separate columns for each of the response variables but instead a column for the response variable name and another for the mean value for that particular response
  # TODO change below to the relevant column names for response variables
  pivot_longer(cols = Preserve_Natural_Beauty:Minimize_Water_Fluctuations, 
               names_to = "question", values_to = "mean")
```

Build the plot I'd shown you! Be sure to modify anything below labeled *TODO* for other predictor or response variables.

```{r}
# TODO change data to dataset with means for the predictor variable (here, `age_means`)
# TODO change below group to whichever predictor variable you want color-coded (here, Age)
ggplot(data = age_means, aes(x = question, y = mean, group = Age)) +
  # Add colorized rectangles based on which questions were significant in the MANOVA
  # TODO change xmin and xmax based on where the specific significant questions are plotted and do +/- 0.5 so the box surrounds the data point
  annotate("rect", xmin = 1.5, xmax = 2.5, ymin = 4, ymax = 5, 
           fill = "mediumseagreen", alpha = 0.5) +
  annotate("rect", xmin = 6.5, xmax = 7.5, ymin = 4, ymax = 5, 
           fill = "mediumseagreen", color = "white", 
           linewidth = 1, alpha = 0.5) +
  annotate("rect", xmin = 7.5, xmax = 8.5, ymin = 4, ymax = 5, 
           fill = "mediumseagreen", color = "white", 
           linewidth = 1, alpha = 0.5) +
  # TODO change below to colorize by whichever predictor variable you want
  geom_line(aes(color = Age)) +
  # TODO change below to colorize by whichever predictor variable you want
  geom_point(aes(color = Age)) +
  # TODO change title of plot to what you'd like
  ggtitle("Age-based means for nature questions") +
  # Specify y and x axis titles
  ylab("Mean response") +
  xlab("Survey question") +
  # TODO customize your color palette for each of the predictor variable groups (here, the three age groups)
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#208c74", "#a82c94", "#bd724b")) +
  # Change the x axis text angle so it doesn't overlap and make font size 10
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 10))

# If you want to save the plot above to your current working directory:
# TODO change "nature_age_means_plot.pdf" to whatever you want the file named
# TODO change `width` and `height` to whatever dimensions you want (in inches)
ggsave("nature_age_means_plot.pdf", width = 10, height = 6)
```

If you want to change the ordering of the survey questions (x axis labels):

```{r}
# Specify the class of the survey question column as a factor and change the levels to whatever ordering you want
age_means$question <- factor(age_means$question, levels = c("Decrease_Bacterial_Levels",
                                                            "Preserve_Natural_Beauty",
                                                            "Preserve_Natural_Shorelines",
                                                            "Control_Invasive_Species",
                                                            "Encourage_Dark_Skies",
                                                            "Improve_Water_Quality",
                                                            "Increase_Water_Clarity",
                                                            "Minimize_Water_Fluctuations",
                                                            "Preserve_Unique_Habitats",
                                                            "Protect_Native_Species",
                                                            "Reduce_Algal_Growth"))

# Now, build the plot in the exact same way as above and you should see the ordering change
# You will need to change the colorized boxes such that they're still behind the significant variables which have now changed place:
ggplot(data = age_means, aes(x = question, y = mean, group = Age)) +
  # Add colorized rectangles based on which questions were significant in the MANOVA
  annotate("rect", xmin = 0.5, xmax = 1.5, ymin = 4, ymax = 5, 
           fill = "mediumseagreen", alpha = 0.5) +
  annotate("rect", xmin = 1.5, xmax = 2.5, ymin = 4, ymax = 5, 
           fill = "mediumseagreen", color = "white", 
           linewidth = 1, alpha = 0.5) +
  annotate("rect", xmin = 2.5, xmax = 3.5, ymin = 4, ymax = 5, 
           fill = "mediumseagreen", color = "white", 
           linewidth = 1, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(aes(color = Age)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Age)) +
  ggtitle("Age-based means for nature questions") +
  # Specify y and x axis titles
  ylab("Mean response") +
  xlab("Survey question") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#208c74", "#a82c94", "#bd724b")) +
  # Change the x axis text angle so it doesn't overlap and make font size 10
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 10))
```

If you want to modify the survey question names (x axis labels), add `scale_x_discrete()` with `labels` specified.

```{r}
ggplot(data = age_means, aes(x = question, y = mean, group = Age)) +
  # Add colorized rectangles based on which questions were significant in the MANOVA
  annotate("rect", xmin = 0.5, xmax = 1.5, ymin = 4, ymax = 5, 
           fill = "mediumseagreen", alpha = 0.5) +
  annotate("rect", xmin = 1.5, xmax = 2.5, ymin = 4, ymax = 5, 
           fill = "mediumseagreen", color = "white", 
           linewidth = 1, alpha = 0.5) +
  annotate("rect", xmin = 2.5, xmax = 3.5, ymin = 4, ymax = 5, 
           fill = "mediumseagreen", color = "white", 
           linewidth = 1, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(aes(color = Age)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Age)) +
  ggtitle("Age-based means for nature questions") +
  # Specify y and x axis titles
  ylab("Mean response") +
  xlab("Survey question") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#208c74", "#a82c94", "#bd724b")) +
  # Change the x axis text angle so it doesn't overlap and make font size 10
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 10)) +
  # TODO below is what changes the x axis labels:
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Decrease Bacterial Levels",
                              "Preserve Natural Beauty",
                              "Preserve Natural Shorelines",
                              "Control Invasive Species",
                              "Encourage Dark Skies",
                              "Improve Water Quality",
                              "Increase Water Clarity",
                              "Minimize Water Fluctuations",
                              "Preserve Unique Habitats",
                              "Protect Native Species",
                              "Reduce Algal Growth"))
```

If you want to instead have the significant questions in a plot to the left and the remaining   questions to the right:

```{r}
# Add a new column to `age_means` that has whether the variable in that row was sig or not:
age_means <- age_means %>% 
  mutate(manova_result = case_when(question %in% c("Decrease_Bacterial_Levels", 
                                                   "Preserve_Natural_Beauty", 
                                                   "Preserve_Natural_Shorelines") 
                                   # Put "sig" in the rows that have the above question
                                   # within the new column ("manova_result")
                                   ~ "sig",
                                   question %in% c("Control_Invasive_Species",
                                                   "Encourage_Dark_Skies",

                                                   "Increase_Water_Clarity",
                                                   "Minimize_Water_Fluctuations",
                                                   "Preserve_Unique_Habitats",

                                   # Put "nonsig" in the rows that have the above question
                                   # within the new column ("manova_result")
                                   ~ "nonsig"))

# I want sig vars plotted first so I'm going to change the levels as I did before:
age_means$manova_result <- factor(age_means$manova_result, levels = c("sig", "nonsig"))

# Now, we can ask ggplot to build our plot but "facet" it on our newly made column such that the sig vars are in one plot and the non-sig ones are in a second one:

  ylab("Mean response") +

  scale_color_manual(values = c("#208c74", "#a82c94", "#bd724b")) +
  # Change the x axis text angle so it doesn't overlap and make font size 10
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 10),
        # TODO change the size of the strip text
        strip.text = element_text(size = 14),
        # TODO remove grey background of strip
        strip.background = element_blank()) +
  # TODO here's the faceting step:
  facet_grid(~manova_result, 
             # Only plot sig or non-sig variables
             scales = "free", 
             # Standardize spacing
             space = "free", 
             # Add custom labels to the strips
             labeller = as_labeller(c("sig" = "Significant questions",
                                      "nonsig" = "Non-significant questions")))
